Firefox tests need geckodriver
It contains a npm package: "geckodriver" also a binary executable file "geckodriver"
So please make sure following things:
1. Make sure "geckodriver": "^4.3.2", is in package.json (prepare to update version)
2. Make sure binary file "geckodriver" is in the repo. We put them in this geckodrier_executable folder. Also the binary file have different versions for different OS. We should down them for local and CI.
3. Make sure the nightwatch.conf.js is configured properly for FireFox and FireFoxHeadless. Which means the webdriver->server_path value should point to the binary file. Here we use process.env.GECKO_PATH to save it. In different test config, we initialize different path for process.env.GECKO_PATH (according to OS)
